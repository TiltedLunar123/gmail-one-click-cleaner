## Supported Versions

The Gmail One-Click Cleaner extension is a small, fast-moving project. Only the most recent public release and the `main` branch receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Gmail One-Click Cleaner, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not publicly disclose details yet.**
2. **Open a private report** by creating a new issue in this repository and clearly marking the title with `[SECURITY]`, or use GitHub’s “Report a vulnerability” / Security Advisory flow if available.
3. Include:
   - A clear description of the issue.
   - Exact steps to reproduce.
   - Browser version and OS.
   - The extension version (from Chrome’s Extensions page).

I aim to:

- Acknowledge new security reports within **7 days**.
- Provide an initial assessment and next steps within **14 days**.
- Release a fix and publish an updated version as quickly as reasonably possible if the issue is confirmed.

If the vulnerability is accepted:

- A fix will be implemented and released in a new version.
- The security notes / changelog will credit you if you’d like (and if it is safe to do so), or you can remain anonymous.

If the report is declined (for example, expected behavior or low risk), you will receive an explanation of why it does not qualify as a security vulnerability for this project.

Thank you for helping keep Gmail One-Click Cleaner and its users safe.
